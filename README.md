# Solution for Project: Knights Travails (The Odin Project)


## Overview

This is a solution for the [Knights Travails](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-knights-travails) project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).


The main task of the project is to implement a function that returns the shortest path between two positions on a chess board for a knight. The function takes a starting and ending position as inputs and returns an array of shortest valid moves in between for the knight.


The function uses a graph data structure to represent the chess board and a breadth-first search algorithm to find the shortest path between the two positions.
